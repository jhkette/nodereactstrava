// TSS = (sec x NP® x IF®)/(FTP x 3600) x 100
// “sec” is duration of the workout in seconds,
// “NP” is Normalized Power® (don’t worry about this for now),
// “IF” is Intensity Factor® (a percentage of your FTP; in other words how intense the effort was),
// “FTP” is Functional Threshold Power (your best average power for a one-hour race or test),
// and “3600” is the number of seconds in an hour.
